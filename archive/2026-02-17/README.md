Historical snapshot reports. For **current** verification use the root docs:

- **RELEASE_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md** — INV-REL-* and INV-REL-GH (including INV-REL-4)
- **GITHUB_RELEASES_GUIDE.md** — How to create releases
- **ECOSYSTEM_CONTRACT_MATRIX.md** — Dependency and CI fallback reference

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| FINAL_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md | Point-in-time verification report (2026-02-17; 0.2.1 era) |
| RELEASE_VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md | Closure summary for that verification run |

These reflect state as of 2026-02-17. Current policy: tag semantics = **INV-REL-4** (tag is ancestor of main), not “tag == main HEAD”.
